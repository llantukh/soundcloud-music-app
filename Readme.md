For this project we had to create an app that made an ajax request to soundcloud and played the music we searched for.

This assignment was really rough for me. There were a lot of new things that we had to use that we had never seen before (data-stream). I basically needed my instructor and the TA to hold my hand through the whole assignment. I left myself a ton of notes in my code explaining what every variable and function does. I"m pretty sure this isn't good practice, but it really helped me wrap my head around everything once I actually sat down and made myself explain what everything does.

Here is the link to the music app:
